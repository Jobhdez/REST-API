# REST-API
made a simple  Django REST API to learn more about this type of system so I can build larger systems

# How to run
Once you have this repo in your system  and you have changed the directory (ie `cd <this-repo>`) type the following to start the server:
              
              python3 manage.py runserver
              
and then point your browser to access the API:

              http://127.0.0.1:8000/research-papers/papers

and to return the JSON representation of the data you entered in the previous step point to:
              
              http://127.0.0.1:8000/research-papers/papers/?format=json
              
              
# Summary
As I said above this is just a simple REST API for the purposes of learning and using it as a base to build large and production web apps and REST APIs.
